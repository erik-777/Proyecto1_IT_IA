This project proposes the development of a machine learning model for the early detection of neurocognitive signs associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease in adults from the Sucre department in Colombia. Given the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders and the lack of updated data and diagnostic tools in underserved regions, this initiative seeks to support territorial health systems with a scalable, accessible, and efficient solution. The study will follow a structured methodology involving variable selection, data collection, model development and validation, and the deployment of a voice-assisted web interface. The goal is to identify relevant biological and psychological variables and integrate them into a functional system that uses voice recognition to collect inputs and deliver predictive assessments. By applying applied research and adhering to international software development standards, the project aims to build a reliable early detection tool that aligns with technological maturity levels up to TRL 5. Results will support the early identification of potential dementia cases, reducing diagnostic delays and improving public health responses.
